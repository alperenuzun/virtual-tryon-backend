### Backend Application of Virtual Try On Glasses

That's a project that I created for both completing the project and discovering some technologies. In this project I have aimed to have experience for TDD, O-Auth, error handling and documentation in Java.

#### Currently used technologies

Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT, REST API, Mockito, Swagger

#### Notes

The explanation about the application and how it works will be updated here by time.
